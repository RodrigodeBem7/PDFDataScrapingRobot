# PDFDataScrapingRobot

The robot loops through a collection of pdf invoices. After scraping all the necessary data, the bot moves the files which were successfully scraped to a folder called "Success". If for some reason there is a file that could not be scraped correctly, this one is moved to a folder called "Failed".
